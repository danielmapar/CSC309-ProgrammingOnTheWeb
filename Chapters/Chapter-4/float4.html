        Don't be sad!  Turn that frown
        <img src="images/sad.png" alt="sad" /> upside down!
        <img class="happy" src="images/smiley.png" alt="smile" />
        Smiling burns calories, you know.
        <img class="puppy" src="images/puppy.jpg" alt="puppy" />
        Anyway, look at this cute puppy; isn't he adorable!  So cheer up,
        and have a nice day.  The End.
